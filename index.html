      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I‚Äôm a hardworking and detail oriented junior web developer with a strong willingness to learn and grow in every aspect of my field. While I‚Äôm freshly graduated and still gaining experience beyond my internship at B-mirk (‚ÄúFriends@work‚Äù), I stay committed to mastering new technologies and improving my understanding every day.
        </p>
        <p>
        My passion lies in the inner workings of computers from troubleshooting and updating hardware, to managing compatibility, system health, and maintenance workflows. I enjoy building web-based tools and interfaces, experimenting with front-end design, and using AI-assisted development strategies to streamline problem solving and boost creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
        I‚Äôll admit: sometimes I struggle to explain things, especially technical concepts out loud but I make up for it with focus, dedication, and hands-on skills that help me bring ideas to life. I‚Äôm not afraid to ask questions, dive deeper, and keep pushing forward until I get it right.
